Metamusic was a project and winner for the Congressional App Challenge of 2020.
It was created by Jake Fulford and Will Sugden.
Metamusic is able to tell if one is playing a musical scale correctly.
It can analyze the bpm and a key of a recording.
It also has a built in tuner and metronome.
Sometimes it take some time for it to start up, but be patient, it will eventually start.
